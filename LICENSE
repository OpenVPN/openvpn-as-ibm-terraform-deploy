# OpenVPN End User License Agreement, Access Server  
**Latest revision date:** October 1, 2024  
**Copyright Notice:** OpenVPN Access Server License; Copyright (c) 2009-2024  
OpenVPN Inc. All rights reserved. “OpenVPN” is a trademark of OpenVPN Inc.

This OpenVPN Access Server End User License Agreement (the “End User License  
Agreement”) sets forth the terms of the license OpenVPN Inc. (”we” or “OpenVPN”)  
grants an authorized user of OpenVPN’s Access Server (“Access Server”). For the  
purposes of this End User License Agreement, references to “you” and “your” will be  
to an authorized user of Access Server.

To be an authorized user, you must accept the terms of the OpenVPN Master  
Product and Services Agreement (the “Master Agreement”), complete and agree to a  
Product and Service Order under which the Recipient has subscribed to purchase a  
license to Access Server (the “Product and Service Order”), and OpenVPN must  
have accepted that subscription. All terms of the Master Agreement and the Product  
and Service Order are incorporated by reference into this End User License  
Agreement except where End User License Agreement specifically states otherwise.

## 1. License Grant.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this End User License Agreement, the Master Agreement and the Product and Service Order, OpenVPN grants you a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use Access Server on a number of servers specified in the Product and Service Order for your business or personal use during the subscription term set forth in the Product and Service Order. You may use Access Server solely for your own lawful business or personal purposes and, except to the extent that redistribution of Access Server is permitted under Section 3, you may not distribute Access Server to any other person in any manner.

## 2. Open Source Licenses.
Access Server is bundled with open source software components, some of which have different licenses. By using Access Server or any of the bundled components, you agree to be bound by the conditions of the license for each respective component as well as this End User License Agreement.

## 3. Transfer and Redistribution of Licenses.
You may redistribute Access Server binary forms and related documents if those redistributions of Access Server binary forms and related documents reproduce the above copyright notice as well as a complete copy of this End User License Agreement. A copy of this End User License Agreement is distributed with the Access Server in the file `/usr/local/openvpn_as/license.txt`. In no event will your redistribution of the binary forms and related documents for Access Server permit you to exceed the number of users or devices for which you subscribed in the Product and Service Order.

## 4. Limitation on Distribution.
Except as permitted in Section 3, you may not assign, sublicense, distribute, or otherwise transfer your license to Access Server or your rights or obligations under this End User License Agreement, agreement and licenses granted by it may not be assigned, sublicensed, or otherwise transferred by you or any of your successors or assigns (including, but not limited to, by means of a change of control or operation of law) without our prior written consent, which we may grant or deny in our sole discretion. We may revoke any license, and may deactivate your license to Access Server, if you transfer or copy Access Server or your license to Access Server in violation of this End User License Agreement.

## 5. No Reverse Engineering.
You agree not to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, make any attempt to discover the source code for Access Server, or create derivative works from Access Server.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranties.
ACCESS SERVER IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS.” OPENVPN EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY THAT ACCESS SERVER WILL COMPLY WITH ITS SPECIFICATIONS OR OPERATE ERROR FREE, AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS SERVER.

## 7. Subscription License Key:
Entitles you to use Access Server for the duration of term of your subscription up to the concurrent user limit specified by your subscription. This license permits you to use Access Server on one or more servers, provided that in no event will the number of concurrent VPN connections that all servers may allow exceed the concurrent user limit. Upon activation of the first purchased activation key for Access Server, you agree to forego any free licenses or keys that were given to you for demonstration purposes, and as such, the free licenses will not appear after the activation of a purchased key. You are responsible for the timely activation of these licenses on the server or servers of your choice.

## 8. Refunds.
Refunds on purchased activation keys are only possible within 30 days of purchase of activation key, and then only if the activation key has not already been activated on a system. To request a refund, you must contact us through our support ticket system using the account you have used to purchase the activation key. Activated subscriptions are nontransferable. An Access Server subscription entitles the use of (1) subscription license key on a single server or across multiple servers. Once an activated key expires or becomes invalid, the concurrency limit on Access Server will revert to demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two (2) concurrent users to be connected to your server.

## 9. Standard Fixed License Key(s):
(a) A Purchased Standard Fixed license entitles you to use this software for the duration of time denoted on your activation key on any one particular device, up to the concurrent user limit specified by your license. Multiple activation keys may be activated to achieve a desired concurrency limit on this given device. Unless otherwise prearranged with OpenVPN Inc., concurrency counts on activation keys are not to be divided for use amongst multiple devices. Upon activation of the first purchased activation key, you agree to forego any free licenses or keys that were given to you for demonstration purposes, and as such, the free licenses will not appear after the activation of a purchased key. You are responsible for the timely activation of these licenses on your desired server of choice.

(b) Activating a standard Fixed key ties it to the specific hardware/software combination that it was activated on, and activated activation keys are nontransferable. Substantial software and/or hardware changes may invalidate an activated license. In case of substantial software and/or hardware changes, caused by for example, but not limited to failure and subsequent repair or alterations of (virtualized) hardware/software, Access Server will automatically attempt to contact our online licensing systems to renegotiate the licensing state. On any given activation key, you are limited to three (3) automatic renegotiations within the activation key lifetime. After these renegotiations are exhausted, the activation key is considered invalid, and the activation state will be locked to the last valid system configuration it was activated on. We reserve the right to grant exceptions to this policy for license holders under extenuating circumstances, and such exceptions can be requested through a ticket via the OpenVPN Access Server ticketing system.

## 10. Expiration of Activation Keys.
Once an activated activation key expires or becomes invalid, the concurrency limit on Access Server will decrease by the number of concurrent connections previously granted by the activation key. If all of your purchased activation key(s) have expired, Access Server will revert to demonstration mode, which allows a maximum of two (2) concurrent users to be connected to your server. Prior to your license expiration date(s), We may remind you to renew your license(s) by sending periodic email messages to the licensee email address on record. You are solely responsible for the timely renewal of your activation key(s) prior to their expiration if continued operation is expected after your subscription term expiration date(s). We will not be responsible for any misdirected and/or undeliverable email messages, nor do we have an obligation to contact you regarding your expiring activation keys.

## 11. Support.
(a) Any valid activation key holder is entitled to use our ticketing system for support questions or issues specifically related to the OpenVPN Access Server product. To file a ticket, go to our website at [https://openvpn.net/](https://openvpn.net/) and sign in using the account that was registered and used to purchase the activation key(s). You can then access the support ticket system through our website and submit a support ticket. Tickets filed in the ticketing system are answered on a best-effort basis. We reserve the right to limit responses to users of our demo / expired licenses, as well as requests that substantively deviate from the OpenVPN Access Server product line. Tickets related to the open-source version of OpenVPN may not be handled here.

(b) Although we will endeavor to respond to support questions submitted through our ticketing system in a prompt manner, we provide no assurance that we will be able to answer support questions within any specific period of time or to resolve all technical problems that may arise with Access Server.

## 12. Not a Hosted Service.
Because Access Server is not a hosted service of OpenVPN, you are responsible for either hosting Access Server on your own computer equipment or selecting a third party to host Access Server. Although we may provide recommendations to you about third-party hosting services you may wish to use, you will be solely responsible for selecting that hosting service and no recommendation we provide constitutes a guaranty by us of performance by that hosting service. All terms of the hosting which that third party hosting service provides to you (including but not limited to those governing system availability, uptime, error correction, technical support, and pricing) will be determined solely by you and that third-party hosting service.

### SQLite Copyright
———————————
SQLite is in the Public Domain.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any means.

The previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code in SQLite – those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship with a larger application. Portions of the documentation and some code used as part of the build process might fall under other licenses. The details here are unclear. We do not worry about the licensing of the documentation and build code so much because none of these things are part of the core deliverable SQLite library.

All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code has been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of code can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have public domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is uncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.
